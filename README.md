 VBA Websocket Asynchronous Sample (Echo Server Client)

This is a VBA client that uses asynchronous calls for the Websocket protocol.  Since this is VBA, it isn't completely "asynchronous", but this is as close as I can get. Feel free to suggest changes, or take over the project.

The "bas" files for can be imported into (Windows only) VBA to make a client that works with an echo server, thanks to: https://websocket.org/
